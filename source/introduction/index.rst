Introduction
============
There are two main topics for understanding programming:- 

1. Environment - the part that's installed on the computer/machine 
2. Language - the part that's installed in the programmer's head 

In order to learn effectively, this course will:- 

* Code in the Cloud - we will NOT go into Environment
* Focus on Problem Solving - break down problem into mind-size bites (decompose)
* Encourage critical thinking through questions / exploration (tinker on your own)

Let's begin !
