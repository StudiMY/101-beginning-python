**Congratulations**, you have leveled up! By now, we hope you have experienced solving problems with Python. 

You might have realized how easy for humans to solve it but extremely difficult to break down solutions into step-by-step instructions for machine to understand.

As you practice to solve more problems, you'll get better at it. Don't give up!
